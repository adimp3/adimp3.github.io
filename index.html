    I been moving calm, don't start no trouble with me
    Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
    Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
    You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
    I don't wanna die for them to miss me
    Yes I see the things that they wishin' on me
    Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
    They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me
