    I got my eyes on you
    You're everything that I see
    I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
    I can't get over you
    You left your mark on me
    I want your high love and emotion endlessly

    'Cause I know that you're somewhere, somehow
    You're stuck in my head, girl
    And I can't get you out of it
    If I knew you were the one
    The one I've been waiting for
    I would have done anything
    Said anything
    I would have done anything
    Said anything
    But you never know
